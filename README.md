# Chapter 1 | Arrays and Strings

[**1.1** Is Unique: Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you cannot use additional data structures?](https://github.com/evelynsv/CrackingTheCodingInterview/blob/main/src/main/java/cracking/the/code/interview/chapter1/Question1_1.java)

[**1.2** Check Permutaion: Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the other.](https://github.com/evelynsv/CrackingTheCodingInterview/blob/main/src/main/java/cracking/the/code/interview/chapter1/Question1_2.java)

[**1.3** URLify: Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20'. You may assume that the string has sufficient space at the end to hold the additional characters, and that you are given the "true" length of the string.](https://github.com/evelynsv/CrackingTheCodingInterview/blob/main/src/main/java/cracking/the/code/interview/chapter1/Question1_2.java)

[**1.4** Palindrome Permutation: Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palindrome. A palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same forwards and backwards. A permuation is a rearrangement of letters. The palindrome does not need to be limited to just dictionary words. You can ignore casing and non-letter characters.](https://github.com/evelynsv/CrackingTheCodingInterview/blob/main/src/main/java/cracking/the/code/interview/chapter1/Question1_4.java)

[**1.5** One Away: There are three types of edits that can be performed on strings: insert a character, remove a character, or replace a character. Given two strings, write a function to check if they are one edit (or zero edits) away.](https://github.com/evelynsv/CrackingTheCodingInterview/blob/main/src/main/java/cracking/the/code/interview/chapter1/Question1_5.java)

[**1.6** String Compression: Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters. For example, the string aabcccccaaa would become a2b1c5a3. If the "compressed" string would not become smaller than the original string, your method should return the original string. You can assume the string has only uppercase and lowercase letters (a - z).](https://github.com/evelynsv/CrackingTheCodingInterview/blob/main/src/main/java/cracking/the/code/interview/chapter1/Question1_6.java)

[**1.7** Rotate Matrix: Given an image represented by an N x N matrix, where each pixel in the image is represented by an integer, write a method to rotate the image by 90 degrees. Can you do this in place?](https://github.com/evelynsv/CrackingTheCodingInterview/blob/main/src/main/java/cracking/the/code/interview/chapter1/Question1_7.java)

[**1.8** Zero Matrix: Write an algorithm such that if an element in a M x N matrix is 0, its entire row and column are set to zero.](https://github.com/evelynsv/CrackingTheCodingInterview/blob/main/src/main/java/cracking/the/code/interview/chapter1/Question1_8.java)

[**1.9** String Rotation: Assume you have a method isSubstring which checks if one word is a substring of another. Given two substrings, s1 and s2, write a code to check if s2 is a rotation of s1 using only one call to isSubstring.](https://github.com/evelynsv/CrackingTheCodingInterview/blob/main/src/main/java/cracking/the/code/interview/chapter1/Question1_9.java)

# Chapter 4 | Trees and Graphs 

[My Trie Implementation (insert/search)](https://github.com/brendonmiranda/CrackingTheCodingInterview/blob/main/src/main/java/data/structure/tree/TrieTree.java)


# Chapter 5 | Bit Manipulation

[**5.1** Insertion: You are given two 32-bit numbers, N and M, and two bit positions, i and j. Write a method to insert M into N such that M starts at bit j and ends at bit i. You can assume that the bits j through i have enough space to fit all of M. That is, if M=10011, you can assume that there ate at least 5 bits between j and i. You would not, for example, have j=3 and i=2, because M could not fully fit between bit 3 and 2.](https://github.com/brendonmiranda/CrackingTheCodingInterview/blob/main/src/main/java/cracking/the/code/interview/chapter5/Question51.java)

[**5.3** Binary to String: You have an integer, and you can flip exactly one bit from 0 to 1. Write code to find the length of the longest sequence of 1's you could create.](https://github.com/brendonmiranda/CrackingTheCodingInterview/blob/main/src/main/java/cracking/the/code/interview/chapter5/Question53.java)

[**5.4** Next Number: Given a positive integer, print the next smallest and the next largest number that have the same number of 1 bits in their binary representation.](https://github.com/brendonmiranda/CrackingTheCodingInterview/blob/main/src/main/java/cracking/the/code/interview/chapter5/Question54.java)

[**5.6** Conversion: Write a function to determine the number of bits you would need to flip to convert integer A to integer B](https://github.com/brendonmiranda/CrackingTheCodingInterview/blob/main/src/main/java/cracking/the/code/interview/chapter5/Question56.java)

[**5.7** Pairwise Swap: Write a program to swap odd and even bits in an integer with as few instructions as possible.](https://github.com/brendonmiranda/CrackingTheCodingInterview/blob/main/src/main/java/cracking/the/code/interview/chapter5/Question57.java)
